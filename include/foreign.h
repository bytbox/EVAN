 * \brief Declarations of foreign functions
 *
 * This header file declares all known foreign functions, which can then be
 * accessed from both the interpreter and any statically linked code. In order
 * to increase portability, the exposed interfaces must be plain C (although
 * obviously, the backends will most likely involve several languages).
 *
 * \TODO this file should be automatically generated from a foreign.xml
