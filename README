Run build.sh and add the bin/ directory to your path. The frontend is 'evan'.

Binary distribution tarballs can be generated with dist.sh (which will call build.sh
as appropriate). Cross-compiling is not supported - the binaries will only work
on the kind of system (arch/os) on which they were constructed.
